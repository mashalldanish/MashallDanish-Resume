        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Mashall Danish and I am a second year biochemistry student at the University of California Riverside. I am a premed student and want to become an Internist and specialize in Med Peds. I have wanted to become a doctor ever since I was seven years old as I spent a lot of time in hospitals. The amazing doctors that I have had inspired me to follow in their footsteps and be able to help heal other people while ensuring that they are comfortable. 
<br><br>

        I also have a passion for community service and enjoy helping out our community as well as others. Giving to others and assisting them in a time of need is something so important because no one ever knows what they are going through. I have been a part of multiple canned food drives for my local food pantry as they run low on food quickly. I also have been blessed with the opportunity to collect and distribute clothing and other necessities to Syrian refugees. This was an amazing experience that allowed me to further understand the struggles people in war torn countries go through. This experience was the catalyst to inspire me to hopefully work towards opening up my own non profit that provides medical care for third world countries.<br><br>
        During my journey as a premed student I have been able to build experience through multiple opportunities. In high school, I was invited to participate the National Youth Leadership Forum at the University of California Los Angeles. This program was for students interested in the medical field. During this program I learned emergency medical protocols, phlebotomy, a basic diagnosis process, intubation, CPR, etc. After this experience I was able to get an internship at a chiropractic office. This was one of my best experiences and I had a lot of patient interaction. I also learned how to correctly log patient visits, bill insurances, create appointments, and assist the patients with anything they may need. 
<br><br>

        Currently I am a part of an organization at my university, Mini Medical School, where we educate ourselves on a topic with approved medical and health related information and then go out and teach the residents of Inland Valley. We are able to raise awareness to relevant health issues and how to prevent them. This is something very important to me because there are a lot of common health issues many face in the Inland Empire but may not be fully educated on the topic. This allows us to help others in becoming more well informed where hopefully we can help direct them to better their health or spread the information to others who may need it. I am also a part of an organization, Hooks for Hope, that I was able to start alongside a friend where we send handmade crochet plushies to children in foster cares as a comfort item. This is another thing that is very important to me because creating comfort for children who do not have stability is something that should be done more often.
